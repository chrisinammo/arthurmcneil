LOADSAMPLEORMIGRATE=Load Sample Data, Restore, or Migrate Backed Up Content
LOADSQLFILE=Loading SQL File...please wait.
LOADSQLINSTRUCTIONS1=<strong>Important!</strong>: It is strongly recommended that new Joomla! Users should install the default Sample Data. This requires selecting the option <i>and</i> clicking on the button before moving to the next stage.
LOADSQLINSTRUCTIONS2=Before leaving the installation you can populate the site database with data. There are three options to do this:
LOADSQLINSTRUCTIONS3=<strong>1. Default Sample Data</strong> can be inserted - To do this select the first option and click the Install Sample Data button.
LOADSQLINSTRUCTIONS4=<strong>2.a Joomla! 1.5 Compatible SQL Script File</strong> can be uploaded from local host and executed on the site. This could be for installing localised sample data or restoring a Joomla! 1.5 backup. The script should have the correct table prefixes, should be in utf-8 encoding and should comply with Joomla! 1.5 database schema.
LOADSQLINSTRUCTIONS5=<strong>2.b Migration of content from previous versions of Joomla!</strong>. Selecting the "Load Migration Script" option enables support for the migration of older Joomla! 1.0.x version database dumps to the new Joomla! 1.5 site. The required conversions are performed on-the-fly. The script file can be created automatically on the old site by using the <code>com_migrator</code> Component.<br/> For further information about the Component and the necessary procedure please see the <a href="http://help.joomla.org/content/view/1933/294/" target="_blank">Joomla! 1.5 Migration Guide</a>.
LOADSQLINSTRUCTIONS6=The Upload facility supports uncompressed SQL script files, Zip packed script files and gz packed script files. Packed files may contain only a single SQL script file. You may tick the "I have already uploaded the migration script" option if you find the file is too big to handle (memory and time limit errors) and upload the file in the /installation/sql/migration/ called <code>migrate.sql</code> (no compression allowed).<br /> Finally...
LOADSQLINSTRUCTIONS7=<strong>3. Clean Installation</strong> If you do not wish to enter any of the sample data, migrate data from a previous site, or upload data from a back-up, but simply wish to create a completely clean and fresh installation, once you have entered the Site Name, Admin e-mail, and password, you simply need to proceed to the <strong>Finish</strong> stage by clicking <em>Next</em>.

TIPCOLLATIONNONUTF=<p>This version of MySQL does not have UTF-8 support which is the required encoding.</p><p>It is recommended that you upgrade your database to a version newer than 4.1.2. If this is not possible, Joomla! will store utf-8 encoded content in your existing database in a backward compatibility mode. Collation selection is not possible in this mode and a default collation will be used.</p>
TIPCOLLATIONUTF=<p>This version of MySQL includes UTF-8 support which is the required encoding.</p><p>Choose a collation from the list. If none appears for your language that is because the default collation <em>utf8_general_ci</em> is suitable.</p>
TIPCONFSTEPS=<br />Enter your e-mail address, this will be the e-mail address of the site Super Administrator.<br />Enter the password and then confirm it in the following fields. This will be the password that you will need at the end of the installation process to login to the Administrator Control Panel together with the username <strong>admin</strong>.<br /> If you are migrating you can ignore this section as your current settings will be automatically migrated.
TIPDATABASE=Some hosts allow only a certain DB name per account. If this is the case use the table prefix option in the following Advanced Parameters section to distinguish more than one Joomla! site.
TIPDATABASESTEPS=<p>Setting up Joomla! to run on your server involves four simple steps...</p>	<p>In this Database Configuration Step:</p><h2>Basic Settings</h2><p>Select the Type of Database from the drop down list. This will generally be <strong>mysql</strong>.</p>	<p>Enter the hostname of the database server Joomla! is to be installed on. Note: This may not necessarily be the same as your Web server so check with your Web Host if in any doubt.</p>\n		<p>Enter the MySQL username, password, and database name you wish to use with Joomla!. These must already exist for the database you are going to use.</p><h2>Advanced Settings</h2>	<p> Select how to handle existing tables from a previous installation.</p><p>Enter a prefix to be used by tables for this Joomla! installation.</p>
TIPFTPCONFSTEPS=<p>Due to file system permission restrictions, within Linux and other Unix sytems, and PHP Safe Mode restrictions in order that all users can utilize the Joomla! installers an FTP Layer exists to handle file system manipulation.<br/>Enter an FTP Username and Password with access to the Joomla! root directory, this will be the FTP Account that handles all file system operations when Joomla! requires FTP access to complete a task.<br/>For security reasons, it is best if a separate FTP User Account is created with access only to the Joomla! installation, and not the whole Web server if this option is available to you.</p><p><b>Note:</b> If the installation is on a Windows Operating System the FTP Layer is <b>not</b> required
TIPHOST=This is usually <strong>localhost</strong> or a host name provided by the hoster
TIPINSTALLDEFAULT=Installing this is strongly recommended for beginners. It will install default sample content that is included in the Joomla! installation package.
TIPLOADMIGRATION=The migration script needs to be created on the old site by the <code>com_migrator</code> tool to conform. Enter the table prefix of the old site and enter the encoding used in old site (_ISO setting in language file or as seen in browser info/encoding/source).
TIPUPLOADED=I have already uploaded the migration script to the server (e.g. via FTP/SCP)
TIPMIGRATION=This script is a Joomla! 1.0 migration script.
TIPLOADSQL=Joomla! 1.5 Migration SQL scripts need to be Joomla 1.5 compatible and should have the appropriate table prefix.
TIPPASSWORD=For site security using a password for the MySQL account is mandatory. This is the same password used to access your database. This may again be preset by your hoster.
TIPPREFIX=Do not use 'bak_' since this is used for backup tables
TIPPREINSTALL=If any of these items is not supported (marked as <strong><font color="#ff0000">No</font></strong>) your system does not match the minimum requirements necessary. Please take the appropriate actions to correct the errors. Failure to do so could lead to your Joomla! installation not functioning correctly.
TIPRECOMSETTINGS=These settings are recommended for PHP in order to ensure full compatibility with Joomla!<br />\nHowever, Joomla! will still operate if your settings do not quite match the recommended.
TIPTYPE=This is probably <strong>MySQL</strong>
TIPUSER=This can be the default MySQL username <strong>root</strong> or a username provided by the hoster, or one that you have created whilst setting up your database server.
