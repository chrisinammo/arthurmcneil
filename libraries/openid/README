PHP OpenID
----------

This is the PHP OpenID library by JanRain, Inc.  You can visit our
website for more information about this package and other OpenID
implementations and tools:

INSTALLATION
============

You will need PHP 4.3.0 or greater to use this library.  We have
tested the library on PHP 4.3.0, 4.4.1, and 5.1.1.

At any time, visit the 'detect.php' script in the examples/ directory
to see a web page detailing the state of your PHP installation.  This
script will tell you if you meet the installation requirements.

Follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies.

   - Enable either the GMP extension or Bcmath extension. (GMP is
     STRONGLY recommended because it's MUCH faster!)  This is
     required.

   - Enable the CURL extension.

   - If you plan to use SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL to store OpenID
     data, you'll need PEAR DB.  You can install this by running this
     as root:

     # pear install DB

     You'll also need to install and enable the appropriate PHP
     database extension.  Alternatively, you can store OpenID data on
     the filesystem instead of using a relational database.  Nothing
     special is required for using the filesystem method.

   - Install either the DOM or domxml PHP XML processing extension.

2. Use the PEAR installer to install the package.  To use the PEAR
   installer, run this command from the package directory:

   # pear install package.xml

   If your PEAR version is sufficiently new, you can run this instead:

   # pear install package2.xml

   If the PEAR installer isn't available, you can copy the Auth/ and
   Services/ directories into your PHP include path.

TESTING YOUR SETUP
==================

You can use the example code to test your setup.  To run the example
consumer or server, follow the instructions in the examples/README
file.

USING THE API
=============

The best way to get started using the API is to take a look at the
example consumer and server in the examples/ directory.  See the
examples/README file for more details.
