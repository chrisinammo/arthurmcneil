JCal Pro is a fork of the existing Extcalendar component for Joomla!
(com_extcal_0_9_2_RC4.zip from mamboguru.com). 
Extcal (http://sourceforge.net/projects/extcal) was renamed 
and adapted to become a Mambo/Joomla! component by 
Matthew Friedman, and further modified by David McKinnis
(mamboguru.com) to repair some security holes.
